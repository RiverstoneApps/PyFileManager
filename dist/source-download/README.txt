**********IMPORTANT***********
Please ONLY open the respective files for your Operating System and/or the .py (source/script file) file (.exe for Windows, .app for MacOS, LinuxBinary for Linux, RPiBinary for Raspberry Pi), as you will encounter issues trying to open the other files.
This is the download that includes the main script that was used to build the .exe, .app and Linux Binary files. To any fellow Developers, I hope you like the code that has gone into this!

This is a Repository for a Python File Manager script, and as of now, allows you to read a file,
write to a file, add to a file, delete a file, list files in a directory, check a file's existence,
move a file, copy a file, rename a file, create a directory, delete a directory and open a program.

To Convert the .py file into a .exe file, I used this tutorial, but took out the -w part of the compiling command:

I hope it will help anyone who needs it!
